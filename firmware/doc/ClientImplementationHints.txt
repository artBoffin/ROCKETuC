==========================================================================

This document tries to give some hints on how to implement a ROCKETuC client.
The descriptions are "high-level" and thus are not tight to a specific 
programming language. 


Requirements
------------

The requirements will be split into "basic" and "advanced". In general a 
client implementing the "basic" requirements will be able to perform "Message xfer" 
as described in the document "ROCKETuC firmware Architecture", and an 
"advanced" client will additionally support "eventing" and "streaming". 


** Basic requirements 

* Core protocol functionality (excluding functionality for eventing)

   - See ROCKETuC protocol definition

* Message xfer: 

   - Send ROCKETuC conform request to MUC, get response from MCU
   - Be able to interpret status responses and process them in a way,
     that the user of the client is able to know what was the problem 


** Advanced requirements

* Eventing functionality and streaming functionality

   - See ROCKETuC protocol definition

* Eventing

   - Receive events, call back user defined handler

* Streaming

   - Offer user access stream 


Handle Hardware Specific Functionality
--------------------------------------

A client implementation should make as less assumptions about the hardware 
used on the MCU as possible. A client should not make any assumptions about
the capabilities a PIN has, about which PINs are reserved or about limited
resources. Instead, it should offer the ROCKETuC protocol functionality 
without restriction, but be aware of the fact, that e.g. requesting a PIN
function from the MCU may result in an error stating "unsupported pin function". 
 
If a client for any reason needs to implement and/or expose hardware specific
functionality, it should clearly state that it is doing so. A good way to 
do so is having a general implementation, and then deriving a hardware specific
implementation from this (including e.g. the hardware class in it's name).


Packet Handling
---------------

** Packet Data Type

A comment thing for all clients is to handle ROCKETuC protocol packets. Thus,
it is a good idea to have a data type (class, struct or what ever the target 
language supports) that represents a ROCKETuC packet. The packet representation
should be able to do at least the following:

* Allow to set/get the attributes defined by the ROCKETuC protocol: 

  - start byte
  - length
  - type
  - data
  - CRC

* Be able to calculate the CRC

* Be able to check the CRC

* Be able to return a representation of itself as byte array 

* Be able to construct itself from an byte array


A packet should not:

* Make assumptions about the transport used later on (thus a packet will be
  usable with any kind of transport)

* Make any assumptions about which packet types are available, or how the 
  packet data will be build (thus a packet will be usable with the ROCKETuC
  core protocol, and with protocol extensions)

A NOTE about "byte": whenever "byte" is used in this document, a 8-bit unsigned
byte is meant. In C this would be "unsigned char", in Java, well there is no such
thing like 8-bit-unsigned-byte, thus one may use "short" or "char" or "byte" (and 
take care about the correct casting). 


** Packet Parsing

As stated above a packet should be able to construct itself from a byte 
representation as for example received from an input stream. On the client
side, only the functionality for parsing MCU response packets is needed. 

Parsing a packet from a stream of bytes could be easily expressed by a 
simple state machine:


bIn : the last byte received

   (NEW_PACKET)
         |
         +-------------+
        \|/            | bIn != START_BYTE 
(WAIT_FOR_START_BYTE)--+			
         |
         | bIn == START_BYTE          save start byte in packet property p.start
         |
         +-------------+
        \|/            | bIn == EMPTY
  (WAIT_FOR_LENGTH)----+
         |
         | bIn == ANY_BYTE            save length in packet property p.length
         |
         +-------------+
        \|/            | bIn == EMPTY
  (WAIT_FOR_TYPE)------+
         |
         | bIn == ANY_BYTE            save type in packet property p.type
         |
         +-------------+
        \|/            | bIn == EMPTY                          
  (WAIT_FOR_DATA)------+
  /|\    |
   |     | bIn == ANY_BYTE,           save data in packet property p.data[i]
   |     |                           
   +-----+ length(p.data) < p.length
         |
         | length(p.data) == p.length
         |
         +--------------+
        \|/             | bIn == EMPTY
  (WAIT_FOR_CRC)<-------+
         |
         | bIn == ANY_BYTE            save CRC in packet property p.crc
         |
        \|/      
  (PACKET_COMPLETE)
   
At the moment a packet is complete, the CRC should be calculated and compared
against the CRC received and stored in p.crc. If the values do not match an
exception should be generated. 


Packet Transportation
---------------------

Heaving a packet is fine, but we need to send the packet content over some
kind of transport (e.g. a serial line). Thus, we need a implementation for a
transport stream which is able to send/receive packets in byte form. Since
we defined above, that a packet itself should know how to represent itself 
as a byte stream and how to assembly itself from a byte stream, the only
thing left for streaming is the functionality for transferring the bytes from
and to the physical transport.


** Sending packet data

Sending of packet data is as simple as asking the packet which should be send 
for its byte representation, and then push each byte on the physical transport.

When doing so, a few things should be kept in mind:

* Sending my stall (e.g. because the MCU is gone). Thus, it may be a good idea 
  to have some sort of timeout, and if that timeout is reached, create an exception.

A implementation for packet streaming my offer something like "sendPacket" as a
convenient function to send the bytes of a whole packet. 


** Receiving packet data 

Receiving packet data is as simple as reading the bytes one after the other from 
the physical transport, and pass it to the packet parser to make it assemble the 
packet. If the parse is part of the packet implementation, it is convenient to 
have a operation like "addByte" which allows to pass the next byte to the parser. 
If the packet also provides a operation like "isComplete", one could simply pump
data read from the transport to the parser (addByte) until the packet states it
is complete (isComplete). 

When doing so, a few things should be kept in mind:

* Receiving may stall (e.g. because the MCU is gone). Thus it may be a good idea
  to have some sort of timeout, and if that timeout is reached, create an exception.

A implementation for packet streaming my offer something like "receivePacket" as a
convenient function to receive and return a whole packet. 


Basic Client
------------

A basic client must implement functionality for packet xfer. This should be fairly 
simple having a packet implementation and a implementation form streaming packets. 
A basic flow for packet xfer may look like this:


                         (START)
                            |
                           \|/ 
                    -----------------       Yes
       +---------> /  retrys > mRT   \------------+
       |           \                 /            |
       |            -----------------             |
       |                    | No                  |
       |                   \|/                    |
       |            +----------------+            |
       |            | Send req. pkt. |            |
       |            +----------------+            |
       |                    |                     |
       |                   \|/                    |
       |      +--------------------------+        |
       |      | Wait until res. pkt.     |        |
       |      | pkt. or waited-time > wT |        |
       |      +--------------------------+        |
       |                    |                     |
       |                   \|/                    |
       |   YES      -----------------             |
       +-----------/  wait-time > wt \            |
                   \                 /            |
                    -----------------             |
                            |                     |
                           \|/                    |
                          (END)<------------------+



Advanced Client
---------------

Things are getting slightly more complicated for an advanced client implementation. 


** Receiver thread

Due to the fact, that an advanced client must be able to receive events at any time
a receiver thread is needed which is able to read all incoming bytes from the
physical transport, and at the time a packet is complete, knows if this was an 
event (which must be passed to an event handler), or if it was a response to a
packet sent earlier. 

By assuming, that the MCU responds to requests in the order they were received the 
client should be thread safe if the "xfer" operation is synchronized in a way that 
no threads at the same time are able to issue an "xfer". 


         Client               ROCKETuC       Receive            
         Thread                 API          Thread      
 
     A             B                                           MCU 
     |             |             |              |               |
1   [|]--xfer------------------>[|]--sendReq------------------>[|]
    [|]            |            [|]--getResp-->[|]             [|]
2   [|]           [|]--xfer---->[|]            [|]<--response--[|]
    [|]           [|]           [|]<---resp----[|]              |

     |            [|]           [|]--getResp-->[|]             [|]
5    |            [|]           [|]            [|]<---event----[|]
   <-------------callEventHandler--------------[|]             [|]
     |            [|]           [|]            [|]<--response--[|]
     |            [|]           [|]<---resp----[|]              |
6    |            [|]<-response-[|]             |               |
     |             |             |              |               |


The figure above shows the following:

1) Client thread A starts an "xfer" by calling the corresponding API
   method. The API uses the physical transport to deliver the message
   to the MCU. It then asks the receiver thread for the next response
   received from the MCU. This call is blocking, thus it will wait
   until a response was received.

2) While thread A waits for its "xfer" to complete, thread B starts
   an other "xfer". Since "xfer" is synchronized by the API, the
   request from thread B will just sit and wait until "xfer" for 
   A completed. 

3) MCU has finished processing of request for "xfer" from A, the response
   was sent back and parsed to a packet by the receiver thread, thus the
   "getResp" call from (1) could now be served, and the API pushes back
   the response to thread A. This completes the "xfer" for A.

4) "xfer" request from B could now be processed, thus the API sends the 
   packet data to the MCU and starts waiting for a response. 

5) While B waits for a response to its request, an event occurs on the MCU. 
   The MCU passes the event to the receiver thread, the receiver thread
   identifies the data as an event packet and passes it to an registered event 
   handler. 

6) Now the receiver thread receives the response to the "xfer" from B and passes
   it to the API. The API passes it back to B and "xfer" for B is complete. 


When heaving a closer look at the sequence form above, a few critical points 
(which one should take care of when implementing) could be identified: 

* When the API waits for a response, it should use a time-out after which it
  cancels the "xfer" with an error. Otherwise all subsequent calls to "xfer" from
  any thread will starve (since "xfer" is synchronized). 

* The receiver thread must check the packet type (by inspecting the start-byte), since
  an "xfer" could be potentially interrupted by an event packet. 


** Streaming

On request, the MCU will stream a value of interest continuously to the client until
the MCU receives an other request from the client. While in streaming mode, no 
events from the MCU are possible. Streaming is stopped at the moment the client sends
an other "xfer" request to the MCU. Only one thread at a time is able to use streaming.

     |             |             |              |               |

    ...           ...           ...                            ...


The figure above shows the following:

1) Client thread A request streaming of a certain value form the MUC through the API.
   The API sends that request to the MCU and waits for the response. 

2) Thread B concurrently requests also streaming. This request is blocked until 
   streaming initiated by thread A has terminated in (7).

3) If the API received a non-error response to thread As stream request, the API asks 
   the receiving thread to handle over a stream object.

4) The stream object is passed back to the client thread. The MCU now may start 
   streaming data at any time.

5) The client thread A uses the stream object received in (4) for retrieving the
   data stream. 

6) The client has to call subsequently the "getData" function of the stream object
   to get newly arrived data form the MCU.

7) Thread A ends streaming by sending a new request to the MCU.

8) The stream request form thread B could now be processed. 

When heaving a closer look at the sequence form above, a few critical points 
(which one should take care of when implementing) could be identified: 

* At 4 we see, that streaming from the MCU could happen at any time. Thus it may
  be a good idea to have some buffer for the data in the receive thread.

* The receive thread must not parse the data from the MCU when in streaming mode
  but just passe the received bytes along (by using the stream object). 

* At 7 thread A ends streaming by issuing a new "xfer". But the stream could be 
  end by any other thread to by staring an "xfer".
