==========================================================================

This is the firmware project used by the ROCKETuC project (http://rocketuc.com). The firmware helps operate a MCU (currently the TI Launchpad with an MSP430G2553 installed) from a host connected through a serial line. For communication, the ROCKuC binary format protocol, as described [here|https://github.com/areben/wiki@TODO], is used.

This README describes, how to compile the firmware binary and flash it to the target MCU under Linux.    


Project Directory Layout
------------------------

The top-level directory structure of the firmware project looks something like this:

+- bin                 Pre-Build FW and test binaries
+- CHANGELOG           Firmware Change-Log
+- common_lib.mk       Common makefile used for library building
+- common.mk           Common makefile used for firmware building
+- doc                 Common documentation
+- libconio            Console IO library (only used by tests)
+- libpacket           Generic packet library for protocol implementation
+- librocketcore       ROCKETuC core (protocol and core functionality)
+- libserial           Serial IO library
+- Makefile            Top-Level makefile
+- README              This README
+- serial-rocket       Firmware which exposes the ROCKETuC on 1st UART
+- test                Various test firmwares
+- tools               Various tools, used mainly internally


Each library sub-project (names starting with "lib*") has the following layout:

+- doc                  Library specific documentation
   +- gen               Source code documentation generated by doxygen (after "make gen-docs")
+- doxygen.conf         Configuration for doxygen
+- lib                  Library in binary format (after "make")
+- Makefile             Library top-level makefile
+- README               Library specific README
+- src                  Library sources 
   +- include           Library header files
   +- Makefile          Library makefile


Each firmware sub-project ("*-rocket" and "test/*") have the following layout:

+- doc                  Firmware specific documentation
   +- gen               Source code documentation generated by doxygen (after "make gen-docs")
+- doxygen.conf         Configuration for doxygen
+- bin                  Firmware in binary format (after "make")
+- Makefile             Firmware top-level makefile
+- README               Firmware specific README
+- src                  Firmware sources 
   +- include           Firmware header files
   +- Makefile          Firmware makefile



Prerequisites
-------------

To compile all the libraries, firmware variants and test firmwares, the following mandatory tools need to be installed on your Linux build-host:

* msp430-gcc for compiling (I use 4.5.3 which is [available on Ubuntu as packet|TODO link to Ubuntu Wiki])
* mspdebug for flashing (I use 0.16 which is [available on Ubuntu as packet|TODO link to Ubuntu Wiki])
* GNU-make or make (I use GNU make 3.81 which is available also as a pecket on Ubuntu) 

To perform some of the extra tasks (like doxygen etc.), the following optional tools need to be installed on your build-host:

* doxygen for creating HTML documentation from the code annotations
* astyle for code formating
* cppcheck for static code checking


Compilation
------------

To compile all the libraries, firmware variants and test firmware, change to the top-level directory "firmware" and issue:

make

This will produce the firmware binares in various formats in the "bin" sub-directory of each variant. Currently the only firmware variant is the "serial-rocket" firmware located in the directory "serial-rocket". It will also produce a bunch of test firmwares located under the "test" directory. For more details on the firmware variants or the tests, see the corresponding README files in the sub-directories. 

NOTE: a pre-compiled version of the firmware and some of the tests could always be found in the top-level "bin" directory".


Flashing
--------

make flash-target

For the MSP430 target on a Launchpad, the "mspdebug" tool is used for flashing. 


Generating API Documents
------------------------

If you installed doxygen on your system, you could generate the HTML-based API documentation by calling:

make gen-docs

This will create the API documentation under "doc/gen/html" within each of the sub-directories of the libraries and firmwares. 


Applying Code Formating Guidelines
----------------------------------

To format all code located in "*.h" and "*.c" files, you could issu the following command in one of the sub-directories:

make style 

This will use "astyle" to format the code in "stroustrup" style.  


Performing Static Code Checks
-----------------------------

To perform static code checks on all files ending with "*.h" or "*.c" , you could issue the following command while in one of the sub-directories:

make check 

This will use "cppcheck" for static code checks and print out the results on the console.  


Tailoring the Build Settings
----------------------------

General build settings (compiler, linker, flags etc.), and settings regarding code formating and static code checks could be adjusted in two files on a global basis: 

common.mk: This is the common make file shared accross all firmware variants as well as by the test firmware. 
common_lib.mk: This is the commen make file shared accross all libraries.
