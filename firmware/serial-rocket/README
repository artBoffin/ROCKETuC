ROCKETuC firmware usable through serial port README

==========================================================================

"serial-rocket" implements the functionality described by the ROCKETuC binary protocoll and provides this functionality through the serial line of the MCU (the build in usb-2-serial converter could be used on the TI Launchpad). The firmware depends on the following libraries from the ROCKETuC firmware project: "libpacket", "libserial" and "librocketcore".  

This README describes, how to compile and flash the firmware under Linux.    


Project Directory Layout
------------------------

* see toplevel README


Prerequisites
-------------

* see toplevel README

Also make sure "libpacket", "libserial" and "librocketcore" libraries are already successfully compiled.


Compilation
------------

To compile this firmware issue:

make

This will produce the firmware "firmware.*" in various formats under the "bin" sub-directory. 


Flashing
--------

make flash-target

For the MSP430 target on a Launchpad, the "mspdebug" tool is used for flashing. 


Generating API Documents

Basic Usage
----------------------------

For the TI Launchpad, connect the USB-port to your PC. Then connect to the MCU through one of the client implementations (e.g. processing library or Java library) by using the following parameters: 

* serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux)
* 9600 bauds
* 8 databits
* 1 stopbits

For examples on using one of the client libraries see the wiki [@TODO].
