==========================================================================

This firmware is for testing "libpacket" over serial line. By doing so, a ROCKETuC protocol mock is provided. The firmware depends on "libpacket" and "libserial".

This README describes, how to compile and flash the firmware under Linux.    


Project Directory Layout
------------------------

* see toplevel README


Prerequisites
-------------

* see toplevel README

Also make sure "libpacket" and "libserial" libraries are already successfully compiled.


Compilation
------------

To compile this firmware issue:

make

This will produce the firmware "firmware.*" in various formats under the "bin" sub-directory. 


Flashing
--------

make flash-target

For the MSP430 target on a Launchpad, the "mspdebug" tool is used for flashing.

Basic Usage
----------------------------

For the TI Launchpad, connect the USB-port to your PC. Then connect to the MCU through serial line by using the following parameters: 

* serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux)
* 9600 bauds
* 8 databits
* 1 stopbits
